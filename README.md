## Project information
This project was made during the 2 days of the [Quantum Internet Hackathon 2022](https://labs.ripe.net/author/karla-white/take-part-in-the-quantum-internet-hackathon-2022/).
The aim of this project is to develop an educational game concept for giving people a possibilities to interact with quantum states.

## Try the game
<!-- ![game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16030020/205505454-ec98adbb-8cc0-4590-982e-edeef8a55584.gif)
The game is hosted on [https://qh-2022.vercel.app/](https://qh-2022.vercel.app/).

The game commands for the **Mario** are:
- **up-arrow**: jump
- **left-arrow**: left
- **right-arrow**: right
- **p**: project the quantum state


The game commands for the **Demogorgon** are:
- **w**: jump
- **a**: left
- **d**: right
- **q**: project the quantum state

## Lore
You can read the comics [HERE](https://github.com/XaBerr/QH2022/raw/main/LORE/mario-mortal-entanglement.pdf).

This is the lore in 6 simple steps:
- Eleven seals the Demogorgon inside the upside-down with a quantum-mechanic book.
- Demogorgon studies the book to go back in Eleven's world and he became a scientist.
- Demogorgon opens a portal to the wrong world, the Mario's one.
- Peach, that know about quantum mechanics, tells to Mario how the two words are interconnected and both Mario and Demogorgon are entangled in the movements.
- Mario decided to fight the Demogorgon running for destroying Demogorgon's laboratory.
- Demogorgon runs to across the portal before Mario can do that.

## Code
The repo has two applications **app** and **demo**.
You can use **demo** for testing the game. The **app** was done to integrate the game with the [netsquid](https://netsquid.org/) simulator. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to merge in time the API (developed for the netsquid) with the game.
